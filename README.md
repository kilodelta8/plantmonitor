Star Track Project: Automated Plant Waterer and MonitorThis document outlines the construction, component list, and deployment instructions for the Automated Plant Waterer and Monitor system, which uses an Arduino Uno for sensor reading and pump control, and a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ running a Flask web server for monitoring, scheduling, and weather-based automation.1.

Arduino Code Upload (plant_controller.ino)The Arduino runs the embedded code that communicates with the Pi over USB Serial.Install Library: Open the Arduino IDE. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries... and install the "DHT sensor library" by Adafruit.Open Code: Copy the full contents of plant_controller.ino into a new Arduino sketch.Upload: Connect the Arduino Uno to your PC (or Mac). Select the correct Board (Arduino Uno) and Port. Click Upload.Disconnect: After successful upload, disconnect the Arduino from the PC.4. Raspberry Pi Deployment (Flask Server)The Flask app (app.py) runs the server, gets weather data, and sends commands to the Arduino via the USB cable.4.1. File Setup (Manual or Clone)Option A: Clone Repository (Recommended for Re-runs)Log in to your Raspberry Pi via SSH or terminal.Install Git if necessary: sudo apt install git.Clone your project repository (assuming you push your files there):git clone [https://your.repo.url/startrack-waterer.git](https://your.repo.url/startrack-waterer.git) /home/pi/plant-waterer
cd /home/pi/plant-waterer
Option B: Manual Copy/CreateCreate the directory structure: mkdir -p /home/pi/plant-waterer/templatesCopy app.py, install.sh, and templates/index.html into /home/pi/plant-waterer/.Ensure install.sh is executable: chmod +x install.sh4.2. Run the InstallerPlug in the Arduino Uno to one of the Raspberry Pi's USB ports. The Pi will power the Arduino.Run the installer script using sudo, your OpenWeatherMap API Key, and your City Name (in quotes if it contains a space).sudo ./install.sh [YOUR_API_KEY] "New York"
The script will:Install Python dependencies (Flask, pyserial, requests).Find the python3 executable path.Create the systemd service (plant_waterer.service).Start the Flask application automatically.4.3. Verification and AccessCheck Status: Verify the service is running:sudo systemctl status plant_waterer.service
Check Logs: View real-time output (including serial data and watering triggers):sudo journalctl -u plant_waterer.service -f
Access Dashboard: Open a browser on any device on the same network and navigate to the Pi's IP address on port 5000:http://[Your.Pi.IP.Address]:5000
5. Next Steps / CalibrationCalibration: Fine-tune the watering logic in app.py (MOISTURE_THRESHOLD, DRY_VALUE_MAX, WET_VALUE_MIN) based on the raw sensor values you observe in the logs for your specific soil.
